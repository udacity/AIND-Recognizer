    "The overall goal of this project is to build a word recognizer for American Sign Language video sequences, demonstrating the power of probabalistic models.  In particular, this project employs  [hidden Markov models (HMM's)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) to analyze a series of measurements taken from videos of American Sign Language (ASL) collected for research (see the [RWTH-BOSTON-104 Database](http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~dreuw/database-rwth-boston-104.php)).  In this video, the right-hand x and y locations are plotted as the speaker signs the sentence.\n",

    "##### Cross-validation folds\n",
    "If we simply score the model with the Log Likelihood calculated from the feature sequences it has been trained on, we should expect that more complex models will have higher likelihoods. However, that doesn't tell us which would have a better likelihood score on unseen data.  The model will likely be overfit as complexity is added.  To estimate which topology model is better using only the training data, we can compare scores using cross-validation.  One technique for cross-validation is to break the training set into \"folds\" and rotate which fold is left out of training.  The \"left out\" fold scored.  This gives us a proxy method of finding the best model to use on \"unseen data\". In the following example, a set of word sequences is broken into three folds using the [scikit-learn Kfold](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html) class object. When you implement `SelectorCV`, you will use this technique."

In the BIC equation, a penalty term penalizes complexity to avoid overfitting, so that it is not necessary to also use cross-validation in the selection process.  There are a number of references on the internet for this criterion.  These [slides](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02433/doc/ch6_slides.pdf) include a formula you may find helpful for your implementation.\n",

DIC scores the discriminant ability of a training set for one word against competing words.  Instead of a penalty term for complexity, it provides a penalty if model liklihoods for non-matching words are too similar to model likelihoods for the correct word in the word set."
